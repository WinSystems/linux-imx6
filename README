               Using the WinSystem's linux-imx git repo with Yocto 
                       to create an SBC35-C398 linux kernel

This GIT repository contains the complete source code tree for the i.MX6 linux 
kernel version 4.9.11-1.0.0. This repository is designed to be pulled down by
the Yocto build system during the creation of system componenets, and isn't
directly usable in a stand-alone manner.

To use this repository, a Yocto build environment for the WinSystems SBC35-C398 
must be created. Instructions for the Yocto setup can be found in the document
"c398q_user_manual_1_4_Rocko.pdf". 

Once the Yocto build environment is setup, componenets for the SBC35-C398 board
can be created using the "bitbake" command. If the target of the bitbake command
includes building a kernel, the Yocto system will use GIT to pull a copy of these
kernel files from the linux-imx repository on the WinSystems GIT server.
